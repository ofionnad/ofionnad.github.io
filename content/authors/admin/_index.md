I am a data scientist currently working as a postdoc applying remote sensing (satellite data) to quantify food security and agricultural adaptation to climate change. My PhD in astrophysics focused on simulations of environments around solar-type stars. Now I lead the research of machine learning and computer vision analysis on our team, working with open source satellite data (e.g. Sentinel-1/2, Landsat, etc.). I'm interested in using optical and radar satellites to inform agricultural policy, large agricultural stakeholders, and the mitigation of climate change.
