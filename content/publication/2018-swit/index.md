abstract: We model the wind of solar analogues at different ages to investigate the evolution of the solar wind. It has been suggested that winds of solar type stars might undergo a change in properties at old ages, whereby stars older than the Sun would be less efficient in carrying away angular momentum than what was traditionally believed.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Has the solar wind changed over its lifetime? We use X and Y to show Z.
